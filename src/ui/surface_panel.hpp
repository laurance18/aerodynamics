// surface_panel.hpp: the surface-pressure panel beside the plot.
//
// Plots Cp along every body surface found in the flow (core/surface_pressure.hpp) against the
// angle around the body, x/c along the free stream or the arc length from the stagnation point, on
// an inverted Cp axis (suction up, as usual in aerodynamics). For a circular cylinder the exact
// curve is drawn under the computed one. Below, for each closed body, the drag and lift per unit
// span from integrating Cp around the surface, next to the exact values for an isolated body
// (d'Alembert: no drag; Kutta-Joukowski: L' = rho V_inf Gamma). Hovering the plot picks the
// nearest surface point, which the main plot marks.

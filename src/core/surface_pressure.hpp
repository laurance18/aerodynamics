// surface_pressure.hpp: pressure coefficient on the bodies of a flow, and the forces on them.
//
// Cp = 1 - |V|^2 / V_inf^2 (Bernoulli with the free stream as reference). The flow is steady,
// incompressible and irrotational, so Bernoulli holds between any two points and Cp is defined
// everywhere, but only when a free stream gives the reference speed (FlowModel::freeStreamSpeed > 0).
//
// Bodies. Any streamline can be replaced by a solid wall; the bodies built by superposition are
// bounded by the dividing streamlines through the stagnation points. findBodySurfaces()
//   1. finds the stagnation points (W = 0) by Newton's method on the analytic W(z), started from a
//      grid of seeds,
//   2. finds the streamlines through each one by sampling v on a small circle around it: they
//      leave or arrive where v is radial (four directions at a simple stagnation point, six at a
//      double one),
//   3. traces those streamlines (RK4 on v/|v|, outgoing ones forward and arriving ones backward)
//      until they reach another stagnation point, a singular point or the edge of the region.
// Two streamlines that leave one stagnation point and meet again at another (or one that returns
// to its start) enclose a closed body: cylinder, lifting cylinder, Rankine oval. With other bodies
// nearby they only nearly meet (see BodySurface::closureGap). Two that leave
// one stagnation point and both run out of the region bound an open body (Rankine half-body), and
// likewise two that arrive at one (the half-body of a sink).
//
// Limitations: only bodies with stagnation points on them are found. A cylinder with
// Gamma > 4 pi a V_inf has its single stagnation point off the surface; what is found then is the
// closed dividing streamline around it, which encloses the fluid circulating with the cylinder
// (a valid body too, with the same forces). Bodies with more than two stagnation points on the
// surface are not assembled.
